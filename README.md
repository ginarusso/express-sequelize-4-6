# Lesson 4.6 Homework: Pets Controller and Routes

For your homework assignment for Lesson 4.6, you're tasked with creating routes and a controller for Pets:

## Set Up the Pets Route
- Develop at least four routes:
    1. **Add a pet**: Route to add a new pet.
    2. **Retrieve all pets**: Route to fetch the list of all pets.
    3. **Delete a pet**: Route to delete a pet based on a given ID.
    4. **Edit a pet**: Route to edit details of a pet using its specific ID.

## Develop the Pets Controller
- This controller should integrate with the Pets Model.
- Implement functions that correspond to each of the routes you've defined.

**Note**: Remember to ensure that each route function in the controller effectively communicates with the Pets Model to carry out the required operations.
